# Spring Boot MVC Project : Student Management System

This project implements a robust backend system using the Spring Boot framework with the MVC design pattern. Leveraging Spring JPA and MySQL database, it is structured into three layers:

1. **Controller**: Responsible for managing data flow between the client and server via REST APIs, ensuring adherence to RESTful principles.
2. **Service**: Acts as the backbone, consolidating and executing business logic to facilitate seamless data flow between the Controller and DAO layers.
3. **DAO**: Handles data persistence efficiently by leveraging Spring JPA with MySQL, ensuring stability and reliability in managing the database system.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Enables seamless communication between client and server, adhering to modern web standards.
- **Data Management**: Provides functionalities for CRUD operations, ensuring smooth handling of student data.
- **Authentication**: Secure endpoints with user authentication to restrict unauthorized access.
